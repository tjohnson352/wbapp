Explanations of Key Concepts
1. Contract Frametime
What It Is: The total weekly working hours for teaching, breaks, and other duties.
How It Is Calculated:
Base contract frametime: 34 hours per week.
Prorated based on work_percent:
At 100 percent work_percent: 34 hours.
At 50 percent work_percent: 17 hours.
Breaks Added: 30 minutes per break. For example:
5 breaks = +2.5 hours â†’ Total = 36.5 hours at full-time.
Who It Applies To: All staff; prorated for part-time employees.
2. Teaching Time
What It Is: The total weekly hours for scheduled lessons (type = TEACHING).
How It Is Calculated:
Standard teaching time: 18 hours per week (full-time).
Prorated based on work_percent. For example:
At 100 percent work_percent: 18 hours.
At 50 percent work_percent: 9 hours.
Middle Manager Reduction:
Teaching time is reduced by 1.5 hours (or more based on local agreements).
Automatically applied by the app based on agreement data. For example:
A middle manager with 100 percent work_percent has a teaching time of 16.5 hours (18 - 1.5).
A middle manager with 50 percent work_percent has a teaching time of 7.5 hours (9 - 1.5).
3. Overtime
How It Is Determined:
Teaching Overtime:
Overtime Teach = Total Teach Time - Adjusted Contract Teaching Time
If the result is negative, it is set to 0.
Frametime Overtime:
Over Frametime = Assigned Frametime - Contract Frametime (with Breaks)
If the result is negative, it is set to 0.
Total Overtime:
Total Overtime = Overtime Teach + Over Frametime.
4. GENERAL/DUTY Activities
What It Is: Non-teaching, non-break scheduled activities.
Examples:
Supervisory duties such as hallway monitoring.
Staff meetings.
Recess duties.
Impact: Included in the total frametime but not counted as teaching time.
5. Gap Violations
What It Is: Insufficient preparation or transition time around teaching activities.
How It Is Handled:
Pre Gap: 5 minutes before teaching for preparation.
Post Gap: 5 minutes after teaching for wrap-up.
In-Between Gap: 5 minutes between consecutive teaching activities for transitions.
Agreements: Locally negotiated and agreed upon via the MBL process.
Member Support: Contact your local representative for clarification.
6. Frametime Violations
What It Is: Misalignment of start or end frametime with scheduled teaching activities.
How It Is Adjusted:
Start Frametime:
Must start 5 minutes before the first teaching activity.
Adjusted to 10 minutes for certain activities such as "art" or "lab," unless exceptions apply (e.g., "pe (theory)").
End Frametime:
Must end 5 minutes after the last teaching activity.
Adjusted to 10 minutes for certain activities unless exceptions apply.
Important: Frametime buffers apply only to teaching activities.
7. Planning Time
What It Is: Unscheduled time within frametime that is 30 minutes or more.
How It Is Calculated:
Identified as "PLANNING" blocks.
Not included in the official schedule downloaded from Schoolsoft.
Purpose: Dedicated time for lesson preparation, grading, and administrative tasks.
